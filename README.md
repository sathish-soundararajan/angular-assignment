### Goal
 Consume the [hackerNews API](https://github.com/HackerNews/API) to list down the **Top stories**  which should look something like below screenshot

### Conditions

 - Angular service should never fire more than single HTTP Request at a time. All the stories should be fetched one after another.
 - Design need not to be exactly as same as above. It's upto your creativity.
 - Must use Angular 2 or above.
 - Send the merge request to the master branch once you are done (Zip the source code and email otherwise).
 - Plus point if you host it yourself in heroku or any other managed services.
 - **Please don't copy paste any code from github.**
